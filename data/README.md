# Data Directory Structure

This directory contains the output data from various evaluation benchmarks.

## Structure

- `aime/` - AIME benchmark results and outputs
- `mmlu/` - MMLU evaluation results and telemetry data
- `planner/` - Planner benchmark results and analysis
- `synthetic/` - Synthetic benchmark outputs and metrics

## Note

The actual data files are ignored by `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean, but the directory structure is preserved to ensure proper organization of evaluation outputs.
